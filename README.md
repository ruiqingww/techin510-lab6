## Lessons Learned
Updated my prompt template using learned techniques

Added Meta MusicGen API (using replicate) so that the web app can direct generated music based on the generated prompt, and display the music

## Future Improvements
Receive real-time data from AWS and input them into the template instead of manually choosing the cadence and heart rate.
